","Like water in the desert is wisdom to the soul. ","What wisdom can you find that is greater than kindness? ","The key of persistence opens all doors closed by resistance. ","Loyalty is the pledge of truth to oneself and others. ","Put all excuses aside and remember this: You are capable. ","Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love. ","Integrity is the choice between what's convenient and what's right. ","Empathy is about finding echoes of another person in yourself. ","Problems can become opportunities when the right people come together.  ","Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement. ","Work hard and be kind and amazing things will happen. ","The fruit of your own hard work is the sweetest. ","Sometimes your only available transportation is a leap of faith. ","Have patience.

","We carry within us, the wonders we seek around us. ","Always be on the lookout for the presence of wonder. ","A bear, however hard he tries, grows tubby without exercise. ","Fitness helps me think better, feel better, and move better. ","Biology is the least of what makes someone a mother. ","The Earth is a fine place and worth fighting for. ","No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks. ","A smile is happiness you\u2019ll find right under your nose. ","To walk into nature is to witness a thousand miracles. ","Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. ","Mindfulness is a way of befriending ourselves and our experience. ","Never be so busy as not to think of others. ","I am not afraid. I was born to do this. ","The rarest, truest beauty is visible only to the heart. ","Outer beauty pleases the eye. Inner beauty captivates the heart. ","Nature is not a place to visit. It is home. ","You are what you give; not what you are given. ","I will sprinkle compliments and uplifting words everywhere I go.  ","I can live for two months on a good compliment.

","Only those who attempt the absurd can achieve the impossible. ","You really can change the world if you care enough. ","Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean. ","One must care about a world one will not see. ","Caring about the happiness of others, we find our own. ","Pray not for easy lives, pray to be stronger men. ","The soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts. ","I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious. ","You just can't beat the person who never gives up. ","When it is dark enough, you can see the stars. ","The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are. ","The strongest of all warriors are these two\u2014Time and Patience. ","Trees that are slow to grow bear the best fruit. ","Good manners will open doors that the best education cannot. ","The visible sign of utter love is an undying smile. ","We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground. ","Hope sees the invisible, feels the intangible, and achieves the impossible. ","The world is incomprehensibly beautiful\u2014an endless prospect of magic and wonder. ","An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day. ","Listen carefully. The answers to our deepest questions are often whispered. ","Either I will find a way, or I will make one. ","Don't be pushed by your problems, be led by your dreams. ","Innovation is to imagine the future and fill in the gaps. ","Wherever we are, it is our friends that make our world. ","There\u2019s not a word yet for old friends who\u2019ve just met. ","Humility isn't denying your strengths; it's being honest about your weaknesses. ","You don\u2019t earn loyalty in a day. You earn loyalty day-by-day. ","In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous. ","The only failure is quitting. Everything else is just gathering information. ","What would you attempt if you knew you could not fail?  ","Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things. ","The best thing to hold onto in life is each other. ","Extend yourself in kindness to other human beings wherever you can. ","When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around. ","Start each day with a positive thought and a grateful heart. ","The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. ","The cure for anything is salt water\u2014tears, sweat, or the sea.\n\n ","Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for others? ","It\u2019s good to be blessed. It\u2019s better to be a blessing. ","Creativity is the way I share my soul with the world. ","Life is short but there is always time enough for courtesy. ","What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul. ","Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle. ","The word 'listen' contains the same letters as the word 'silent'. ","It is only as we develop others that we permanently succeed. ","Only passions, great passions, can elevate the soul to great things. ","Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. ","The love we give away is the only love we keep. ","We must take care of our families wherever we find them. ","Family and friendships are two of the greatest facilitators of happiness. ","Let your joy be in your journey\u2014not in some distant goal. ","Compassion is the keen awareness of the interdependence of all things. ","Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly. ","Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen. ","Children must be taught how to think, not what to think. ","It\u2019s what you learn after you know it all that counts. ","Your success will be determined by your own confidence and fortitude. ","Loyalty is the strongest glue\u2014which makes a relationship last a lifetime.  ","Every experience is a stitch in the fabric of your character. ","Joy; the kind of happiness that doesn\u2019t depend on what happens. ","An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail. ","Courtesy is a small act but it packs a mighty wallop. ","Every great story happened when someone decided not to give up. ","Family means putting your arms around each other and being there. ","The most important thing in the world is family and love. ","Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things. ","It is a happiness to wonder\u2014it is a happiness to dream. ","In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can. ","Give thanks for a little and you will find a lot. ","Let the beauty of what you love be what you do. ","If you really love something, just go ahead and do it. ","When there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. ","A book is a dream that you hold in your hand. ","Forgive yourself for your faults and your mistakes and move on. ","The people who give you their food give you their heart. ","You must do the thing which you think you cannot do. ","Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach. ","The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows. ","Not knowing when the dawn will come, I open every door.  ","It seems the harder I work, the more luck I have. ","Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body. ","A room without books is like a body without a soul. ","Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. ","You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible. ","No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted. ","It's never too late to be what you might have been. ","I believe success is achieved by ordinary people with extraordinary determination. ","Don't find the time to exercise, make the time to exercise. ","There are always flowers for those who want to see them. ","Have patience with all things, but, first of all with yourself. ","Trade your expectation for appreciation and the world changes for you. ","Friends and good manners will carry you where money won't go. ","Falling down is part of life. Getting back up is living. ","Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames. ","Remember, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent. ","There's something about love that people just have to respond to. ","Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forwards. ","If the world seems cold to you, kindle fires to warm it. ","In necessary things, unity; in disputed things, liberty; in all things, charity. ","Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them. ","True forgiveness is when you can say \u2018Thank you for that experience\u2019. ","Character consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries. ","Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less. ","If you see someone without a smile, give them one of yours. ","Choose love and peace will follow. Choose peace and love will follow. ","It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.  ","I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning to sail my ship. ","Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire. ","If you carry joy in your heart, you can heal any moment. ","Good words bring good feelings to the heart. Speak with kindness, always.  ","Mind. Body. Soul. These are the three things self-care is all about. ","Rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. ","Forgiveness does not change the past, but it does enlarge the future. ","Forgiveness says you are given another chance to make a new beginning. ","A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. ","Do not let making a living prevent you from making a life. ","Live from the heart of yourself. Seek to be whole, not perfect. ","Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can. ","Make living your life with absolute integrity and kindness your first priority. ","You must be the change you wish to see in the world. ","Wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity of the human spirit. ","Every person that you meet knows something you don't; learn from them. ","You can always, always give something, even if it is only kindness! ","Chase down your passion like it\u2019s the last bus of the night. ","Keep your face always toward the sunshine\u2014and shadows will fall behind you.  ","Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit. ","How you look at it is pretty much how you\u2019ll see it. ","We must accept finite disappointment, but we must never lose infinite hope. ","Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. ","One child, one teacher, one book, one pen can change the world. ","Nature is painting for us, day after day, pictures of infinite beauty. ","Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting. ","The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing. ","Smile, it is the key that fits the lock of everybody\u2019s heart. ","Taking care of yourself doesn't mean me first, it means me too. ","Love is not only something you feel, it is something you do. ","Family and friends are hidden treasures, seek them and enjoy their riches. ","The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have. ","No matter how dark the moment, love and hope are always possible. ","In the truest sense, freedom cannot be bestowed; it must be achieved. ","Don\u2019t just aspire to make a living. Aspire to make a difference. ","A man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder. ","There's a difference between doing things right and doing the right thing. ","The smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention. ","Whatever the soul knows how to seek, it cannot fail to obtain. ","The soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience. ","Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going.  ","Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it. ","Being inclusive is having a human connection without placing judgments before it. ","Those who are happiest are those who do the most for others. ","There is only one happiness in life. To love and be loved. ","Kindness isn't about the thanks you get. It's about the act itself. ","Experience shows that success is due less to ability than to zeal. ","All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust. ","One man practicing sportsmanship is far better than a hundred teaching it. ","Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all. ","Respect for ourselves guides our morals; respect for others guides our manners. ","Always do right. This will gratify some people and astonish the rest.  ","Always do your best. What you plant now, you will harvest later. ","Volunteers do not necessarily have the time; they just have the heart. ","It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are. ","The best preparation for tomorrow is to do today's work superbly well.  ","Joy is a net of love in which you can catch souls. ","When you realize nothing is lacking, the whole world belongs to you. ","You cannot be lonely if you like the person you're alone with. ","True forgiveness is when you can say, \u2018Thank you for that experience.\u2019 ","Where the battle rages, there the loyalty of the soldier is proved. ","Joy goes against the foundations of mathematics: it multiplies when we divide. ","Sometimes its not the strength but gentleness that cracks the hardest shells. ","The final forming of a person's character lies in their own hands. ","I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. ","Good manners sometimes means simply putting up with other people's bad manners.\n ","There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.  ","The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. ","It is often in the darkest skies that we see the brightest stars. ","To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought. ","Our character is what we do when we think no one is looking. ","Listening is where love begins: listening to ourselves and then to our neighbors. ","I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community. ","We lose ourselves in the things we love. We find ourselves there, too. ","Self-discipline coupled with passion and innovation will get you far in this world. ","Unity is strength\u2026when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved. ","Friends are medicine for a wounded heart and vitamins for a hopeful soul. ","Anything is possible when you have the right people there to support you. ","We shall never know all the good that a simple smile can do. ","Life doesn\u2019t get easier or more forgiving, we get stronger and more resilient. ","Laughing cheerfulness throws the light of day on all the paths of life. ","Giving is not just about making a donation, it's about making a difference. ","There is nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. ","It is not in numbers, but in unity, that our great strength lies. ","Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you've imagined. ","Nurture your minds with great thoughts. To believe in the heroic makes heroes. ","The truth of your character is expressed through the choice of your actions. ","It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light. ","We are made to persist. That's how we find out who we are. ","Each one of us can make a difference. Together we make a change. ","Live in the sunshine, swim in the sea, drink the wild air\u2019s salubrity. ","Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort. ","In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.  ","The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the common. ","Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart. ","To live a life fulfilled reflect on the things you have with gratitude. ","Kindness can become its own motive. We are made kind by being kind. ","When you walk a life of honesty, you live a life of truth. ","The gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a person perfected without trials.  ","Make no small plans for they have no power to stir the soul. ","She read books as one would breathe air, to fill up and live. ","It takes each of us to make a difference for all of us. ","All for one and one for all, united we stand divided we fall. ","Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in. ","Victory is in the quality of the competition, not just the final score. ","All the statistics in the world can\u2019t measure the warmth of a smile. ","Successful people are not gifted; they just work hard, then succeed on purpose. ","The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn't being said. ","Use what you\u2019ve been through as fuel, believe in yourself and be unstoppable! ","The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all. ","The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination. ","Freedom means the opportunity to be what we never thought we would be. ","I have found that if you love life, life will love you back. ","Just being there for someone can sometimes bring hope when all seems hopeless. ","Teaching kids to count is fine, but teaching them what counts is best. ","It's not so much how busy you are, but why you are busy. ","The only way to do great work is to love what you do. ","There is no development physically or intellectually without effort, and effort means work. ","Other things may change us, but we start and end with the family.  ","Try to be like the turtle - at ease in your own shell.\n ","Life is a matter of choices, and every choice you make makes you. ","Leadership is a two-way street. Respect for one's superiors; care for one's crew. ","There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship. ","Certain things catch your eye, but pursue only those that capture the heart. ","If you really want to do something, you will work hard for it. ","Happiness lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. ","I do believe something magical can happen when you read a good book. ","Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out. ","Nothing liberates our greatness like the desire to help, the desire to serve. ","To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal. ","What counts can\u2019t always be counted; what can be counted doesn\u2019t always count. ","You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it. ","Strength does not come from physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable will. ","Life is not so short but that there is always time for courtesy. ","Good manners and soft words have brought many a difficult thing to pass. ","It is not beauty that endears, it\u2019s love that makes us see beauty. ","It's not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are. ","Diamonds are nothing more than chunks of coal that stuck to their jobs. ","The very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. ","To love and be loved is to feel the sun from both sides. ","Honesty is the best policy. If I lose mine honor, I lose myself. ","Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. ","Then, one day, when you least expect it, the great adventure finds you. ","It's faith that will take you through, and determination that will drive you. ","The only thing worse than being blind is having sight and no vision. ","You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have. ","Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere. ","To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong. ","He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how. ","A ship is safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for. ","An ounce of practice is generally worth more than a ton of theory. ","Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live. ","Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold. ","Believe deep down in your heart that you're destined to do great things. ","If you can't do great things, do small things in a great way. ","Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day. ","The roots of all goodness lie in the soil of appreciation for goodness. ","Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough. ","He who has health, has hope; and he who has hope, has everything. ","No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another. ","Don\u2019t let a bad day trick you into thinking you have a bad life. ","You have to create your life. You have to carve it, like a sculpture. ","Great opportunities to help others seldom come, but small ones surround us every day. ","There is no magic to achievement. It\u2019s really about hard work, choices, and persistence. ","Generosity consists not the sum given, but the manner in which it is bestowed. ","True humility is being able to accept criticisms as graciously as we accept compliments. ","Pride is concerned with who is right. Humility is concerned with what is right. ","The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams. ","Confidence comes not from always being right, but from not fearing to be wrong. ","How do we change the world? One random act of kindness at a time. ","So powerful is the light of unity that it can illuminate the whole earth. ","There are always new things to find out if you go looking for them. ","A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination, and hard work. ","It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it. ","Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep. ","There was never a night or a problem that could defeat sunrise or hope. ","Remember that the happiest people are not those getting more, but those giving more. ","Humility is the ability to give up your pride and still retain your dignity. ","Believe in your infinite potential. Your only limitations are those you set upon yourself. ","Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. ","When you say 'yes' to others, make sure you aren't saying 'no' to yourself. ","Integrity is what we say, what we do, and what we say we do. ","Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there. ","A good coach can change a game. A great coach can change a life. ","Be strong, go with your heart, and believe in miracles because anything...anything can happen. ","Imagination is not just the catalyst of art, it\u2019s also the catalyst of compassion. ","Innovation is the ability to see change as an opportunity \u2013 not a threat. ","Personality begins where comparison leaves off. Be unique. Be memorable. Be confident. Be proud. ","A life is not important except in the impact it has on other lives. ","Joy is the holy fire that keeps our purpose warm and our intelligence aglow. ","Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love. ","The big challenge is to become all that you have the possibility of becoming. ","Create what sets your heart on fire and it will illuminate the path ahead. ","I took a walk in the woods and came out taller than the trees. ","Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish. ","Good character is the single most important attribute of a successful and worthy life. ","Our ability to handle life\u2019s challenges is a measure of our strength of character. ","It is said that wisdom lies not in seeing things, but seeing through things. ","We need to remember that circumstances don\u2019t make a person, they reveal a person.  ","How do you spell love? (Piglet)\nYou don't spell love. You feel it. (Winnie-the-Pooh) ","Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. ","Cheers to a new year and another chance for us to get it right. ","Aim to make a difference in someone\u2019s life every single day, including your own. ","The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. ","The most creative act you will ever undertake is the act of creating yourself. ","The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul. ","Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth. ","Education is the way to move mountains, to build bridges, to change the world. ","Appreciation...acknowledges the presence of good wherever you shine the light of your thankful thoughts. ","Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence. ","If I take care of my character, my reputation will take care of itself. ","You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both. ","There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. ","I close my eyes to old ends. And open my heart to new beginnings. ","Kindness is a language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see. ","Whatever you want to do, do it now! There are only so many tomorrows. ","A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work. ","Purpose is the reason you journey. Passion is the fire that lights the way. ","Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you. ","Honesty is the fastest way to prevent a mistake from turning into a failure. ","We know the truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart. ","Looking at beauty in the world, is the first step of purifying the mind. ","If you love someone, the greatest gift you can give them is your presence. ","Kids don't remember what you try to teach them. They remember what you are. ","We take care of the future best by taking care of the present now. ","Don't try to be perfect; Just be an excellent example of a human being. ","My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together. ","What the caterpillar calls the end of the world, the master calls a butterfly. ","Before you put on a frown, make absolutely sure there are no smiles available. ","It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer. ","It's one of the greatest gifts you can give yourself, to forgive. Forgive everybody. ","Trust is the glue of life. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships. ","We should certainly count our blessings, but we should also make our blessings count. ","In recognizing the humanity of our fellow beings, we pay ourselves the highest tribute. ","Although the world is full of suffering, it's full also of the overcoming it. ","Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. ","You only live once - but if you work it right, once is enough. ","The purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one.\n ","The sign of a beautiful person is that they always see beauty in others. ","You must never be fearful about what you are doing when it is right. ","If you're doing your best, you won't have any time to worry about failure. ","All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them. ","Men succeed when they realize that their failures are the preparation for their victories. ","Can you imagine what I would do if I could do all I can? ","Begin at once to live, and count each separate day as a separate life. ","Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others. ","Loyalty means nothing unless it has at its heart the absolute principle of self-sacrifice. ","You're only responsible for being honest, not for someone else's reaction to your honesty. ","Some people grumble that roses have thorns; I am grateful that thorns have roses. ","Don\u2019t practice until you get it right. Practice until you can\u2019t get it wrong. ","Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one. ","Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. ","To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you. ","You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe deserve your love and affection. ","You have the capability to change your life all with a simple shift in perspective. ","Each time we face our fear, we gain strength, courage and confidence in the doing. ","A love of learning has a lot to do with learning that we are loved. ","Discovery is seeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought. ","You have power over your mind\u2014not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. ","When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives. ","I would rather walk with a friend in the dark, than alone in the light. ","A gentle word, a kind look, a good-natured smile can work wonders and accomplish miracles. ","If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great. ","To be able to look back upon one's life in satisfaction, is to live twice. ","When the power of love overcomes the love of power the world will know peace. ","Inner peace doesn\u2019t come from getting what we want, but from remembering who we are. ",'And you ask \u201cwhat if I fall?" Oh but my darling, what if you fly?\u201d ',"Every small positive change we make in ourselves repays us in confidence in the future. ","When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too. ","Hope smiles from the threshold of the year to come, whispering 'it will be happier'... ","I have found that among its other benefits, giving liberates the soul of the giver. ","The strongest trust is built by the smallest actions, the keeping of the little promises. ","Magic is believing in yourself, if you can do that, you can make anything happen. ","We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.  ","Courage doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t get afraid. Courage means you don\u2019t let fear stop you.  ","Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. ","There's only one way to succeed in anything, and that is to give it everything. ","Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted. ","We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.  ","There is no power for change greater than a community discovering what it cares about. ","Surrender to what is, let go of what was, have faith in what will be.  ","Some succeed because they are destined to, but most succeed because they are determined to. ","Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier. ","A simple smile. That\u2019s the start of opening your heart and being compassionate to others. ","Take care, be kind, be considerate of other people and other species, and be loving. ","Listening is an art that requires attention over talent, spirit over ego, others over self.  ","Unexpected kindness is the most powerful, least costly, and most underrated agent of human change. ","Your attitude towards problems, difficulties, and adversities is the most important factor in overcoming them. ","If we were meant to stay in one place, we\u2019d have roots instead of feet. ","It is not joy that makes us grateful; it is gratitude that makes us joyful. ","Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. ","\u201cWhat day is it?\u201d asked Pooh. \u201cIt\u2019s today,\u201d squeaked Piglet. \u201cMy favorite day,\u201d said Pooh. ","We all came in on different ships, but we're all in the same boat now. ","Movement is a medicine for creating change in a person's physical, emotional, and mental states. ","If you become a helper of hearts, springs of wisdom will flow from your heart. ","There is no such thing as a perfect parent so just be a real one. ","Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children. ","Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play. ","When you live for a strong purpose, hard work isn\u2019t an option. It\u2019s a necessity. ","I feel the capacity to care is the thing which gives life its deepest significance. ","Be happy in the moment, that\u2019s enough. Each moment is all we need, not more. ","At the height of laughter, the universe is flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities. ","The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others. ","We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. ","Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it. ","We cannot reach the goal by mere words alone. Without practice, nothing can be achieved. ","Three keys to more abundant living: caring about others, daring for others, sharing with others. ","Integrity is telling myself the truth. And honesty is telling the truth to other people. ","When it comes time to die, let us not discover that we have never lived.  ","My mission is to create a world where we can live in harmony with nature. ","To be a champ you have to believe in yourself when no one else will. ","When being together is more important than what you do, you are with a friend. ","There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up. ","The easiest way to make an impact in your community is just to be kind. ","You are braver than you believe, smarter than you seem, and stronger than you think. ","Keeping busy and making optimism a way of life can restore your faith in yourself. ","The best way to cheer yourself up is to try to cheer somebody else up. ","Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. ","What we do today, right now, will have an accumulated effect on all our tomorrows.  ","Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn. ","To get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with.  ","Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness. ","The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.  ","Create the highest, grandest vision possible for your life, because you become what you believe. ","Working hard is important. But there is something that matters even more: believing in yourself. ","Your present circumstances don\u2019t determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start. ","We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. ","A good teacher can inspire hope, ignite the imagination, and instill a love of learning. ","Sometimes you will never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory. ","If everyone helps to hold up the sky, then one person does not become tired. ","You can\u2019t put a limit on anything. The more you dream, the farther you get.  ","You are never too old to set another goal or to dream a new dream. ","A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence. ","Vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over. ","Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay, it's not the end.  ","The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. ","To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all. ","We can not solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them. ","The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return. ","Equality is not in regarding different things similarly, equality is in regarding different things differently. ","In every conceivable manner, the family is link to our past, bridge to our future.\n ","Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss it you will land among the stars. ","The most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen. Just listen. ","Deep listening is the kind of listening that can help relieve the suffering of another person. ","Ask yourself: Have you been kind today? Make kindness your modus operandi and change your world.  ","From what we get, we can make a living; what we give, however, makes a life. ","Work and live to serve others, leave the world a little better than you found it. ","Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt. ","Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy and serenity. ","When you get stronger everything in the world gets easier. Change yourself and you've changed everything.\n ","Good friends are like stars. You don't always see them, but you know they're always there. ","Happiness, not in another place, but this place... not for another hour, but for this hour. ","It didn\u2019t matter how big our house was; it mattered that there was love in it. ","Having somewhere to go is home, having someone to love is family, having both is blessing. ","If you have much, give of your wealth; if you have little, give of your heart. ","True compassion means not only feeling another's pain but also being moved to help relieve it.  ","When your ambition is greater than your fear, your life will get bigger than your dream. ","It\u2019s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life\u2019s story will develop. ","Persistence and resilience only come from having been given the chance to work though difficult problems. ","I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it. ","If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. ","The greatness of a community is most accurately measured by the compassionate actions of its members. ","Forgive, forget. Bear with the faults of others as you would have them bear with yours. ","Patience is not simply the ability to wait - it's how we behave while we're waiting.  ","There never was any heart truly great and generous, that was not also tender and compassionate. ","Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way. ","The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart. ","Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds that you plant. ","And suddenly you know: It's time to start something new and trust the magic of beginnings. ","Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love. ","To thrive in life you need three bones. A wishbone. A backbone. And a funny bone. ","Those who are lifting the world upward and onward are those who encourage more than criticize. ","If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier. ","It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed. ","Difficulties are meant to rouse, not discourage. The human spirit is to grow strong by conflict. ","Character may be manifested in the great moments, but it is made in the small ones. ","I define joy as a sustained sense of well-being and internal peace\u2014a connection to what matters. ","Being aware of your fear is smart. Overcoming it is the mark of a successful person. ","What is creative living? Any life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. ","You don\u2019t learn to walk by following rules. You learn by doing, and by falling over. ","It is your response to winning and losing that makes you a winner or a loser.  ","Don't be satisfied with stories of how things have gone with others. Unfold your own myth. ","I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that. ","We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we give. ","Neither genius, fame, nor love show the greatness of the soul. Only kindness can do that. ","You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice you have. ","There is nothing so strong or safe in an emergency of life as the simple truth. ","Above everything else I've done, I've always said I've had more guts than I've got talent. ","What is grit? Grit is refusing to give up. It\u2019s persistence. It\u2019s making your own luck. ","You don't have to accept the invitation to get angry. Instead, practice forgiveness, empathy and encouragement. ","The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires. ","Luck to me is something else; hard work and realizing what is opportunity and what isn't.  ","In family life, love is the oil that eases friction, the cement that binds closer together.  ","It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities. ","Never let a problem to be solved become more important than the person to be loved.  ","We are all unique, and have our own special place in the puzzle of the universe. ","In matters of principle, stand like a rock; in matters of taste, swim with the current.  ","I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity an obligation; every possession a duty. ","A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song. ","It is my chief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble. ","Great changes may not happen right away, but with effort even the difficult may become easy. ","We don't need to share the same opinions as others, but we need to be respectful. ","Real strength is not just a condition of one's muscle, but a tenderness in one's spirit. ","A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. ","Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.  ","Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better. ","Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. ","When you do things from your soul, you feel a river moving in you, a joy. ","You cannot discover new oceans unless you have the courage to lose sight of the shore. ","Health is the greatest of all possessions; a pale cobbler is better than a sick king. ","Be nice to people on your way up because you'll meet them on your way down. ","We have two ears and one tongue so that we would listen more and talk less. ","Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail. ","There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few that we can solve by ourselves. ","I always wondered why somebody didn\u2019t do something about that; then I realized that I am somebody. ","We say 'things will turn out', but no. It's what we do that actually creates the future. ","I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it. ","Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  ","If you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion.  ","People grow through experience if they meet life honestly and courageously. This is how character is built. ","In all of living have much joy and laughter. Life is to be enjoyed not just endured. ","May your walls know joy, may every room hold laughter, and every window open to great possibility. ","Acceptance is simply love in practice. When you love, you accept, when you lack love, you judge. ","The real voyage of discovery lies not in seeking new lands, but in seeing with new eyes. ","Then give to the world the best you have. And the best will come back to you. ","Friendship, love, health, energy, enthusiasm, and joy are the things that make life worth living and exploring. ","Great things can be achieved by leading through wisdom, empathy, and integrity\u2014with no other agenda than humanity. ","Our chief want is someone who will inspire us to be what we know we could be. ","A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions. ","Success isn't always about greatness. It's about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. ","Joy is a decision, a really brave one, about how you are going to respond to life. ","Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and I\u2019ll show you someone who has overcome adversity. ","I don\u2019t like to gamble, but if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m willing to bet on, it\u2019s myself. ","If you don't stick to your values when they are being tested, they're not values: they're hobbies. ","The strength of the team is each individual member. The strength of each member is the team. ","Good, better, best. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best. ","We are each other\u2019s harvest; we are each other\u2019s business; we are each other\u2019s magnitude and bond. ","The purpose of training is to tighten up the slack, toughen the body, and polish the spirit. ","Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. ","I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. ","Patience is more than simply learning to wait. It is having learned what is worth your time. ","A few simple tips for life: feet on the ground, head to the skies, heart open-quiet mind. ","Life itself is a privilege. But to live life to the fullest- well, that is a choice. ","Creativity involves breaking out of established patterns in order to look at things in a different way. ","If you were born with the weakness to fall. You were born with the strength to rise. ","One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say. ","Beauty is about being comfortable in your own skin. It's about knowing and accepting who you are. ","Ask not what your teammates can do for you. Ask what you can do for your teammates. ","True beauty is born through our actions and aspirations and in the kindness we offer to others. ","My family is my life, and everything else comes second as far as what's important to me. ","Don\u2019t be afraid to be ambitious about your goals. Hard work never stops. Neither should your dreams. ","I believe we each walk our paths so we can learn and share those lessons with others. ","We can choose to be affected by the world or we can choose to affect the world.  ","There is no effect more disproportionate to its cause than the happiness bestowed by a small compliment. ","The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us. ","I set out on a journey of love, seeking truth, peace and understanding. I am still learning. ","To encourage literature and the arts is a duty which every good citizen owes to his country. ","We always kept in our hearts the most noble, beautiful feeling that sets human beings apart: hope. ","I am not the same, having seen the moon shine on the other side of the world.  ","It is the province of knowledge to speak and it is the privilege of wisdom to listen. ","I can't think of any better representation of beauty than someone who is unafraid to be herself. ","Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not. ","Love is the the most radically subversive activism of all, the only thing that ever changed anyone. ","Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out. ","Character, the willingness to accept responsibility for one's own life, is the source from which self-respect springs. ","Appreciation is a wonderful thing. It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well. ","Live today. Not yesterday. Not tomorrow. Just today. Inhabit your moments. Don't rent them out to tomorrow. ","Nothing is ever lost by courtesy. It is the cheapest of pleasures, costs nothing, and conveys much. ","The real test of good manners is to be able to put up with bad manners pleasantly. ","I am not this hair, I am not this skin, I am the soul that lives within. ","Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. ","Honesty is more than not lying. It is truth telling, truth speaking, truth living, and truth loving. ","The real voyage of discovery consists of not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes. ","Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are. ","Without commitment, you cannot have depth in anything, whether it's a relationship, a business or a hobby. ","Go into the world and do well. But more importantly, go into the world and do good. ","If my mind can conceive it, my heart can believe it, I know I can achieve it! ","Remember, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. ","Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. ","Wherever there is a human in need, there is an opportunity for kindness and to make a difference. ","We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same. ","Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other. ","It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from. The ability to triumph begins with you. ","Laugh my friend, for laughter ignites a fire within the pit of your belly and awakens your being. ","When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.  ","The smallest change in perspective can transform a life. What tiny attitude adjustment might turn your world around? ","You have all the reason in the world to achieve your grandest dreams. Imagination plus innovation equals realization. ","Education is everything\u2014education is your power, education is your way in life for whatever you want to do. ","Only those who have learned the power of sincere and selfless contribution experience life's deepest joy: true fulfillment. ","I believe that the greatest gift you can give your family and the world is a healthy you. ","The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers. But above all, the world needs dreamers who do. ","Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives won\u2019t have a title until much later. ","That\u2019s what kindness is. It\u2019s not doing something for someone else because they can\u2019t, but because you can. ","Creative people do not see things for what they are; they see them for what they can be. ","The unselfish effort to bring cheer to others will be the beginning of a happier life for ourselves. ","Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings. ","The best teachers are those who show you where to look but don\u2019t tell you what to see. ","Education is our passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today. ","There\u2019s only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that\u2019s your own self. ","It is easier to reach our potential when we learn the value of including others in our quest. ","The mind is like a flower. It does not bloom without the lights of appreciation, encouragement, and love. ","For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.  ","Fitness is not about being better than someone else. It\u2019s about being better than you used to be.  ","My mentor said, \u2018Let\u2019s go do it,\u2019 not \u2018You go do it.\u2019 How powerful when someone says, \u2018Let\u2019s!\u2019. ","You're off to Great Places!\nToday is your day!\nYour mountain is waiting,\nSo... get on your way! ","One of the tests of leadership is the ability to recognize a problem before it becomes an emergency. ","Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good. ","Everything we do is practice for something greater than where we currently are.  Practice only makes for improvement. ","Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart.

We are the movers and shakers of the world forever, it seems.  ","Participate joyfully in the sorrows of the world. We cannot cure the world of sorrows, but we can choose to live in joy. ","Without ambition one starts nothing. Without work one finishes nothing. The prize will not be sent to you. You have to win it. ","Learn to love without condition. Talk without bad intention. Give without any reason. And most of all, care for people without any expectation. ","Freedom is not the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose - and commit myself to - what is best for me. ","The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must be felt with the heart. ","If you wait until you can do everything for everybody, instead of something for somebody, you'll end up not doing anything for anybody. ","I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy. ","Sometimes, reaching out and taking someone's hand is the beginning of a journey. At other times, it is allowing another to take yours. ","We can\u2019t heal the world today. But we can begin with a voice of compassion, a heart of love, and an act of kindness.

","Compassion is not just feeling with someone, but seeking to change the situation\u2026 if you are going to be compassionate, be prepared for action! ","Love and kindness are never wasted. They always make a difference. They bless the one who receives them, and they bless you, the giver. ","Life has many ways of testing a person's will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once. ","The joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives. ","So many of our dreams at first seem impossible, then they seem improbable, and then, when we summon the will, they soon become inevitable.  ","Honesty, equality, kindness, compassion, treating people the way you want to be treated and helping those in need. To me, those are traditional values. ","The most powerful, efficient energy source in the world is your own mind.\xa0 Explore and discover that it can make creative fuel from anything.

","The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore. ","Speak in such a way that others love to listen to you. Listen in such a way that others love to speak to you. ","The molecules of your body are the same molecules that make up the nebulae, that burn inside the stars themselves. We are star stuff. ","The person who makes a success of living is the one who sees his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly. That is dedication.  ","Be who you are and say what you feel, because in the end those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter. ","When we face the worst that can happen in any situation, we grow. When circumstances are at their worst, we can find our best. ","Books are the quietest and most constant of friends; they are the most accessible and wisest of counselors, and the most patient of teachers. ","Dedication involves making the space to let young ideas take hold; every tree was once a seed and every company was once an idea. ","Loyalty and devotion lead to bravery. Bravery leads to the spirit of self-sacrifice. The spirit of self-sacrifice creates trust in the power of love. ","Give yourself entirely to those around you. Be generous with your blessings. A kind gesture can reach a wound that only compassion can heal. ","Service is the rent we pay for being. It is the very purpose of life, and not something you do in your spare time.

One must believe in it. And it isn\u2019t enough to believe in it. One must work at it. ","At 211 degrees, water is hot. At 212 degrees, it boils. And with boiling water, comes steam. And with steam, you can power a train.  ","A highly developed values system is like a compass. It serves as a guide to point you in the right direction when you are lost. ","After every storm the sun will smile; for every problem there is a solution, and the soul's indefeasible duty is to be of good cheer. ","Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basic of dynamic and creative intellectual activity. ","It\u2019s not an easy journey, to get to a place where you forgive people. But it is such a powerful place, because it frees you. ","Genuine tolerance does not mean ignoring differences as if differences made no difference. Genuine tolerance means engaging differences within a bond of civility and respect. ","When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy, care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life. ","To me, good health is more than just exercise and diet. It\u2019s really a point of view and a mental attitude you have about yourself. ","When something bad happens you have three choices. You can let it define you, let it destroy you, or you can let it strengthen you. ","Nature has been for me, for as long as I remember, a source of solace, inspiration, adventure, and delight; a home, a teacher, a companion. ","Treat people the way you want to be treated.

","Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which they have overcome. ","They say a person needs just three things to be happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for.

","Fear less, hope more; Eat less, chew more; Whine less, breathe more; Talk less, say more; Love more, and all good things will be yours!  ","We must not allow the clock and the calendar to blind us to the fact that each moment of life is a miracle and mystery. ","Loyalty is what makes us trust, trust is what makes us stay, staying is what makes us love, and love is what gives us hope. ","Do you know the difference between education and experience? Education is when you read the fine print; experience is what you get when you don't. ","True education does not consist merely in the acquiring of a few facts of science, history, literature, or art, but in the development of character. ","In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go. ","Just follow your joy. Always. I think that if you do that, life will take you on the course that it\u2019s meant to take you. ","Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough. ","Expect to have hope rekindled. Expect your prayers to be answered in wondrous ways. The dry seasons do not last. The spring rains will come. ","We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love.

","You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it come true. You may have to work for it, however. ","One of the great ironies of life is this: he or she who serves almost always benefits more than he or she who is served. ","The road of life twists and turns and no two directions are ever the same. Yet our lessons come from the journey, not the destination. ","You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us. And the world will live as one. ","Our soul desires to be understanding, our ego is only concerned with being understood. When you are being understanding you are connected to your soul. ","We may have different religions, different languages, different colored skin, but we all belong to one human race. We all share the same basic values. ","While we do our good works let us not forget that the real solution lies in a world in which charity will have become unnecessary. ","Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others. If you have that awareness, you have good manners, no matter what fork you use. ","Now, feel. I am thee and thou art me and all of one is the other. And feel now. Thou hast no heart but mine. ","We spend precious hours fearing the inevitable. It would be wise to use that time adoring our families, cherishing our friends and living our lives. ","This above all-to thine own self be true, and it must follow, as night follows day, thou canst not then be false to any man. ","The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. ","If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant; if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome. ","Become a possibilitarian. No matter how dark things seem to be or actually are, raise your sights and see possibilities\u2014always see them, for they\u2019re always there. ","I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from doing a single thing that I wanted to do. ","You know the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Knowledge is knowing tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is knowing you don't put tomato in a fruit salad. ","Carry out a random act of kindness, with no expectation of reward, safe in the knowledge that one day someone might do the same for you. ","No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars, or sailed to an uncharted land, or opened a new heaven to the horizon of the spirit. ","Fear grows out of the things we think; it lives in our minds. Compassion grows out of the things we are, and lives in our hearts. ","The ideals which have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been kindness, beauty and truth. ","The happiness of one's own heart alone cannot satisfy the soul; one must try to include, as necessary to one's own happiness, the happiness of others. ","Nothing in life is to be feared. It is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. ","Balance, peace, and joy are the fruit of a successful life. It starts with recognizing your talents and finding ways to serve others by using them.  ","We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power we need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better. ","Now I know the secret of making the best persons; it is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the Earth. ","I honestly think it's the thing I like most, to laugh. It cures a multitude of ills. It's probably the most important thing in a person. ","Just as we develop our physical muscles through overcoming opposition \u2013 such as lifting weights \u2013 we develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and adversity. ","The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him positively. ","For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others. ","The most basic of all human needs is the need to understand and be understood. The best way to understand people is to listen to them. ","My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style. ","Call it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family: Whatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one. ","Three things in human life are important. The first is to be kind. The second is to be kind. And the third is to be kind. ","Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or leading to do. ","Permanence, perseverance and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities: It is this that in all things distinguishes the strong soul from the weak. ","They say a person needs just three things to be truly happy in this world: someone to love, something to do, and something to hope for. ","It may take courage to embrace the possibilities of your own potential, but once you've flown past the summit of your fears, nothing will seem impossible. ","Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ","Leaders who win the respect of others are the ones who deliver more than they promise, not the ones who promise more than they can deliver. ","Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. ","There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living. ","For last year's words belong to last year's language. And next year's words await another voice. And to make an end is to make a beginning. ","He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying. ","Infinitely more important than sharing one's material wealth is sharing the wealth of ourselves\u2014our time and energy, our passion and commitment, and, above all, our love. ","I don't dwell on my age. It might limit what I can do. As long as I have my mind and health, it's just a number. ","The heart of a volunteer is never measured in size, but by the depth of the commitment to make a difference in the lives of others. ","With courage you will dare to take risks, have the strength to be compassionate, and the wisdom to be humble. Courage is the foundation of integrity. ","We look forward to the time when the power to love will replace the love of power. Then will our world know the blessing of peace. ","Until we have seen someone's darkness, we don't really know who they are. Until we have forgiven someone's darkness, we don't really know what love is. ","Neither a lofty degree of intelligence, nor imagination, nor both together, go to the making of genius. Love, Love, Love. That is the soul of genius. ","Dare to be what you are, and learn to resign with a good grace all that you are not and to believe in your own individuality. ","Instead of thinking about where you are, think about where you want to be. It takes twenty years of hard work to become an overnight success. ","To be whole. To be complete. Wildness reminds us what it means to be human, what we are connected to rather than what we are separate from. ","To achieve a kinder world, we must approach kindness with ambition and dedication. We must practice it in every moment of our lives. Kindness is that important. ","I think, at a child's birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift would be curiosity. ","Most of us, swimming against the tides of trouble the world knows nothing about, need only a bit of praise or encouragement\u2014and we will make the goal. ","It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it, and make it the life you want to live. ","When I dare to be powerful to use my strength in the service of my vision then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid. ","What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life - to be with each other in silent unspeakable memories. ","Don\u2019t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. ","The greatest discovery of our generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind. As you think, so shall you be. ","There is no greater gift you can give or receive than to honor your calling. It's why you were born. And how you become most truly alive. ","It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever \u2013 the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.  ","Being thankful is not always experienced as a natural state of existence, we must work at it, akin to a type of strength training for the heart. ","Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of life contains three descriptions: could have, might have and should have. ","There is no mistaking love. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. ","Loyalty is something you give regardless of what you get back, and in giving loyalty, you\u2019re getting more loyalty; and out of loyalty flow other great qualities. ","Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom. ","If our hopes of building a better and safer world are to become more than wishful thinking, we will need the engagement of volunteers more than ever. ","The most fortunate are those who have a wonderful capacity to appreciate again and again, freshly and naively, the basic goods of life, with awe, pleasure, wonder. ","Be aware of what others are doing, applaud their efforts, acknowledge their successes, and encourage them in their pursuits. When we all help one another, everybody wins. ","You have a chance every single morning to make that change and be the person you want to be. You just have to decide to do it. ","There is one spectacle grander than the sea, that is the sky; there is one spectacle grander than the sky, that is the interior of the soul. ","A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow. ","Inclusion to me is walking up to someone and being yourself and having a full conversation with them and getting to know them as who they are. ","People can do whatever they want if they just set their heart to it, and just never give up, and just go out there and do it. ","What I admire in Columbus is not his having discovered a world, but his having gone to search for it on the faith of his own opinion. ","Sometimes our light goes out but is blown into flame by another human being. Each of us owes deepest thanks to those who have rekindled this light. ","If you have a dream, don\u2019t just sit there. Gather courage to believe that you can succeed and leave no stone unturned to make it a reality. ","The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy. ","Strength of a character isn't always about how much you can handle before you break. It\u2019s also about how much you can handle after you've been broken. ","Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet. Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, vision cleared, ambition inspired, and success achieved. ","Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are. ","You must take personal responsibility. You cannot change the circumstances, the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself. That is something you have charge of. ","An invisible red thread connects those who are destined to meet, regardless of time, place, or circumstance. The thread may stretch or tangle, but will never break. ","For each new morning with its light, For rest and shelter of the night, For health and food, for love and friends, For everything Thy goodness sends.\n ","A cup that is already full cannot have more added to it. In order to receive the further good, we must give of that which we have. ","In the end, the number of prayers we say may contribute to our happiness, but the number of prayers we answer may be of even greater importance.  ","If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward. ","Love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we\u2019ll change the world. ","I know you've heard it a thousand times before, but it's true... hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. ","The purpose of life, after all, is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. ","Stay afraid, but do it anyway. What\u2019s important is the action. You don\u2019t have to wait to be confident. Just do it and eventually the confidence will follow.  ","There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves, it is not my nature. ","Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize? ","If you have made mistakes, even serious ones, there is always another chance for you.  What we call failure is not the falling down, but the staying down. ","And still, after all this time, the Sun has never said to the Earth,\u2018You owe me.\u2019 Look what happens with love like that. It lights up the sky. ","Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; choosing what is right over what is fun, fast, or easy; and choosing to practice our values rather than simply professing them. ","Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today. ","If you feel like there\u2019s something out there that you\u2019re supposed to be doing, if you have a passion for it, then stop wishing and just do it. ","life, seek the company of a friendly book\u2026 from the reading of \u2018good books\u2019 there comes a richness of life that can be obtained in no other way. ","Never underestimate the valuable and important difference you make in every life you touch for the impact you make today has a powerful rippling effect on every tomorrow. ","Life is a great and wondrous mystery, and the only thing we know that we have for sure is what is right here right now. Don\u2019t miss it.  ","You cannot talk about grit\u2014you have to embody it.\nYou cannot talk about faith\u2014you have to live it.\nYou cannot talk about the desert\u2014you have to cross it. ","Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great. ","One thing I\u2019ve learnt about humans: you can\u2019t judge their strength by the size of their actions, but by the devotion of an act, no matter how small. ","If you want to make a difference and leave your world a better place, let others know how important they are as you put their needs above yours. ","Anyone can look for fashion in a boutique or history in a museum. The creative explorer looks for history in a hardware store and fashion in an airport. ","Home is people. Not a place. If you go back there after the people are gone, then all you can see is what is not there any more.

","Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find the right road. ","It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things. ","Confront the dark parts of yourself, and work to banish them with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your angels to sing. ","Destiny is no matter of chance. It is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved. ","Even after all this time the sun never says to the earth, 'You owe me.' Look what happens with a love like that. It lights the whole sky. ","Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step; only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find his right road. ","Comedy is defiance. It's a snort of contempt in the face of fear and anxiety. And it's the laughter that allows hope to creep back on the inhale. ","Keep your dreams alive. Understand to achieve anything requires faith and belief in yourself, vision, hard work, determination, and dedication. Remember all things are possible for those who believe. ","Although time seems to fly by, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. ","The creative is the place where no one else has ever been. You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. ","Rest and self-care are so important. When you take time to replenish your spirit, it allows you to serve from the overflow. You cannot serve from an empty vessel. ","Always dream and shoot higher than you know you can do. Do not bother just to be better than your contemporaries or predecessors. Try to be better than yourself.  ","Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years. People grow old by deserting their ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up wrinkles the soul. ","Self-care is a deliberate choice to gift yourself with people, places, things, events, and opportunities that recharge our personal battery and promote whole health \u2014 body, mind, and spirit.

","For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone. ","In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you.  ","There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self-mastery.

","When we feel love and kindness toward others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace. ","Sportsmanship for me is when a guy walks off the court and you really can't tell whether he won or lost, when he carries himself with pride either way. ","There are those whose lives affect all others around them. Quietly touching one heart, who in turn, touches another. Reaching out to ends further than they would ever know. ","One must have the adventurous daring to accept oneself as a bundle of possibilities and undertake the most interesting game in the world - making the most of one's best. ","It's a funny thing about life, once you begin to take note of the things you are grateful for, you begin to lose sight of the things that you lack. ","Into each day, put in about one teaspoonful of good spirits, a dash of fun, a pinch of folly, a sprinkling of play, and a heaping cupful of good humor!\n ","I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. ","The joy of brightening other lives, bearing each others' burdens, easing others' loads and supplanting empty hearts and lives with generous gifts becomes for us the magic of the holidays. ","Anytime we can listen to our true self and give the care it requires, we do it not only for ourselves, but for the many others whose lives we touch.  ","Today if anything is trying to hold you back, give no attention to it. Get your hopes up, get your faith up, look up, and get ready to rise up. ","An optimist understands that life can be a bumpy road, but at least it is leading somewhere. They learn from mistakes and failures, and are not afraid to fail again. ","Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for granted\u2014folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them. ","At times you have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition. What you'll discover will be wonderful. What you'll discover is yourself. ","Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope, and that enables you to laugh at life's realities. ","Aim for success, not perfection. Never give up your right to be wrong, because then you will lose the ability to learn new things and move forward with your life.  ","A lesson for all of us is that for every loss, there is victory, for every sadness, there is joy, and when you think you\u2019ve lost everything, there is hope. ","Forget yesterday - it has already forgotten you. Don't sweat tomorrow - you haven't even met. Instead, open your eyes and your heart to a truly precious gift - today. ","One of the greatest moments in anybody's developing experience is when he no longer tries to hide from himself but determines to get acquainted with himself as he really is.  ","Begin doing what you want to do now. We are not living in eternity. We have only this moment, sparkling like a star in our hand-and melting like a snowflake\u2026 ","All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost. ","If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. ","Miss no single opportunity of making some small sacrifice, here by a smiling look, there by a kindly word; always doing the smallest right and doing it all for love.  ","Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. ","Love yourself, respect yourself. Never sell yourself short. Believe in yourself regardless of what other people think. You can accomplish anything, absolutely anything, if you set your mind to it. ","Ambition, fueled by compassion, wisdom and integrity, is a powerful force for good that will turn the wheels of industry and open the doors of opportunity for you and countless others. ","No act of kindness is too small. The gift of kindness may start as a small ripple that over time can turn into a tidal wave affecting the lives of many. ",'Patience is power. Patience is not an absence of action; rather it is "timing" it waits on the right time to act, for the right principles and in the right way. ',"Simple kindness may be the most vital key to the riddle of how human beings can live with each other in peace, and care properly for this planet we all share. ","Kindness isn't sacrifice so much as it is being considerate for the feelings of others, sharing happiness, the unselfish thought, the spontaneous and friendly act, forgetfulness of our own present interests.  ","Being humble means recognizing that we are not on earth to see how important we can become, but to see how much difference we can make in the lives of others. ","If the world is to be healed through human efforts, I am convinced it will be by ordinary people, people whose love for this life is even greater than their fear.  ",'You may be whatever you resolve to be. Determine to be something in the world and you will be something. \u201cI cannot,\u201d never accomplished anything; "I will try,\u201d has wrought wonders. ',"If human beings are perceived as potentials rather than problems, as possessing strengths instead of weaknesses, as unlimited rather than dull and unresponsive, then they thrive and grow to their capabilities. ","Each person has an ideal, a hope, a dream which represents the soul. We must give to it the warmth of love, the light of understanding and the essence of encouragement. ","Obstacles don\u2019t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don\u2019t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it or work around it. ","I haven\u2019t a clue how my story will end, but that\u2019s all right. When you set out on a journey and night covers the road, that\u2019s when you discover the stars. ","We plant seeds that will flower as results in our lives, so best to remove the weeds of anger, avarice, envy and doubt, that peace and abundance may manifest for all. ","A good character is the best tombstone. Those who loved you, and were helped by you, will remember you when forget-me-nots have withered. Carve your name on hearts, not on marble. ","If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships - the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together, in the same world at peace.  ","Dedicate some of your life to others. Your dedication will not be a sacrifice. It will be an exhilarating experience because it is an intense effort applied toward a meaningful end. ","As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison. ","There are painters who transform the sun to a yellow spot, but there are others who with the help of their art and their intelligence, transform a yellow spot into sun. ","While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. ","We all should know that diversity makes for a rich tapestry, and we must understand that all the threads of the tapestry are equal in value no matter what their color. ","When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, \u2018Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.\u2019 ","Optimism is a strategy for making a better future. Because unless you believe that the future can be better, you are unlikely to step up and take responsibility for making it so. ","I claim to be a simple individual liable to err like any other fellow mortal. I own, however, that I have humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps. ","We like to think of our champions and idols as superheroes who were born different from us. We don\u2019t like to think of them as relatively ordinary people who made themselves extraordinary. ","Have the courage to say no. Have the courage to face the truth. Do the right thing because it is right. These are the magic keys to living your life with integrity. ","Compassion is a power that we first bestow on ourselves and then give away through our actions\u2014to people, to our planet. When we recognize this, that is when love becomes our legacy.  ","A smile starts on the lips, A grin spreads to the eyes, A chuckle comes from the belly; But a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, Overflows, and bubbles all around. ","Today I choose to live with gratitude for the love that fills my heart, the peace that rests within my spirit, and the voice of hope that says all things are possible. ","To help yourself, help others. Whatever good you do travels a circle and returns to you many times over- but remember, life isn't about what you get, it's about what you become. ","I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it. I want to have lived the width of it as well. ","The diversity in the human family should be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend together in the making of a perfect chord. ","I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear. ","In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing. ","At the heart of each of us, whatever our imperfections, there exists a silent pulse of perfect rhythm, which is absolutely individual and unique, and yet which connects us to everything else. ","When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us. ","Do more than belong: participate. Do more than care: help. Do more than believe: practice. Do more than be fair: be kind. Do more than forgive: forget. Do more than dream: work. ","I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to what light I might have.  ","A smile starts on the lips, a grin spreads to the eyes, a chuckle comes from the belly; but a good laugh bursts forth from the soul, overflows, and bubbles all around. ","Let me not pray to be sheltered from dangers, but to be fearless in facing them.Let me not beg for the stilling of my pain, but for the heart to conquer it. ","Maybe the journey isn\u2019t so much about becoming anything. Maybe it\u2019s about un-becoming everything that isn\u2019t really you, so you can be who you were meant to be in the first place. ","There's a difference between interest and commitment. When you're interested in doing something, you do it only when it's convenient. When you're committed to something, you accept no excuses - only results. ","The earth will not continue to offer its harvest, except with faithful stewardship. We cannot say we love the land and then take steps to destroy it for use by future generations. ","I am only one, but I am one.  I cannot do everything, but I can do something.  And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do. ","A true friend knows your weaknesses but shows you your strengths; feels your fears but fortifies your faith; sees your anxieties but frees your spirit; recognizes your disabilities but emphasizes your possibilities. ","Remember that when you leave this earth, you can take with you nothing that you have received-only what you have given: a full heart enriched by honest service, love, sacrifice and courage. ","Take a stand for what's right. Raise a ruckus and make a change. You may not always be popular, but you'll be part of something larger and bigger and greater than yourself. ","And then there is the most dangerous risk of all...the risk of spending your life not doing what you want on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later. ","The bond that links your true family is not one of blood, but of respect and joy in each other's life. Rarely do members of one family grow up under the same roof. ","Practice the art of adventure by breaking the chain of routine, renewing your life through reading new books, traveling to new places, making new friends, taking up new hobbies and adopting new viewpoints. ","The most beautiful people I\u2019ve known are those who have known trials, have known struggles, have known loss, and have found their way out of the depths\u2026 Beautiful people do not just happen ","At the end of the day, it's not about what you have or even what you've accomplished\u2026 It's about who you've lifted up, who you've made better. It's about what you've given back. ","Make up your mind that no matter what comes your way, no matter how difficult, no matter how unfair, you will do more than simply survive. You will thrive in spite of it. ","An understanding heart is everything in a teacher, and cannot be esteemed highly enough. One looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feeling. ","People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. ","For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you. ","Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. Their meanings can only be articulated by the inaudible language of the heart. ","Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect. ","If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.\n\n ","For every beauty there is an eye somewhere to see it. For every truth there is an ear somewhere to hear it. For every love there is a heart somewhere to receive it.  ","At the end of the day, tell yourself gently: 'I love you, you did the best you could today, and even if you didn't accomplish all you had planned, I love you anyway.' ","The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well. ","True beauty is not related to what color your hair is or what color your eyes are. True beauty is about who you are as a human being, your principles, your moral compass. ","We all have our own life to pursue, our own kind of dream to be weaving, and we all have the power to make wishes come true, as long as we keep believing. ","What makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn't have any doubt - it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn't want to go anywhere else. ","I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve. ","The root of all health is in the brain. The trunk of it is in emotion. The branches and leaves are the body. The flower of health blooms when all parts work together. ","One of the greatest things you can do to help others is not just to share and give what you have, but to help them discover what they have within themselves to help themselves. ","Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future. ","We think we listen, but very rarely do we listen with real understanding, true empathy. Yet listening, of this very special kind, is one of the most potent forces for change that I know. ","And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it. ","Mindfulness is the aware, balanced acceptance of the present experience... It is opening to or receiving the present moment, pleasant or unpleasant, just as it is, without either clinging to it or rejecting it. ","This I do know beyond any reasonable doubt. Regardless of what you are doing, if you pump long enough, hard enough and enthusiastically enough, sooner or later the effort will bring forth the reward. ","When you come to the edge of all that you know, you must believe one of two things: either there will be ground to stand on, or you will be given wings to fly. ","To be courageous requires no exceptional qualifications, no magic formula. It's an opportunity that sooner or later is presented to us all and each person must look for that courage in their own soul.  ","The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning. ","The dictionary is the only place that success comes before work. Hard work is the price we must pay for success. I think you can accomplish anything if you're willing to pay the price. ","To endure is greater than to dare; to tire out the hostile fortune; to be daunted by no difficulty; to keep heart when all have lost it- who can say this is not greatness?  ","I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I do know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve. ","Most of us serve our ideals by fits and starts. The person who makes a success of living is the one who sees his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly. That is dedication. ","The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand. ","Listen to the mustn'ts, child. Listen to the don'ts. Listen to the shouldn'ts, the impossibles, the won'ts. Listen to the never haves, then listen close to me... Anything can happen, child. Anything can be. ","True grit is making a decision and standing by it, doing what must be done. No moral man can have peace of mind if he leaves undone what he knows he should have done. ","Your truest friends are the ones who will stand by you in your darkest moments-because they're willing to brave the shadows with you-and in your greatest moments-because they're not afraid to let you shine. ","Excellence is the result of caring more than others think is wise, risking more than others think is safe, dreaming more than others think is practical, and expecting more than others think is possible. ","Desire is the key to motivation, but it\u2019s determination and commitment to an unrelenting pursuit of your goal - a commitment to excellence - that will enable you to attain the success you seek. ","Time is too slow for those who wait, too swift for those who fear, too long for those who grieve, too short for those who rejoice, but for those who love, time is eternity. ","Hard work is painful when life is devoid of purpose. But when you live for something greater than yourself and the gratification of your own ego, then hard work becomes a labor of love. ","At times our own light goes out and is rekindled by a spark from another person. Each of us has cause to think with deep gratitude of those who have lit the flame within us. ","Do it again. Play it again. Sing it again. Read it again. Write it again. Sketch it again. Rehearse it again. Run it again. Try it again.\nBecause again is practice, and practice is improvement. ","This is my wish for you: peace of mind, prosperity through the year, happiness that multiplies, health for you and yours, fun around every corner, energy to chase your dreams, joy to fill your holidays! ","I say to myself that I shall try to make my life like an open fireplace, so that people may be warmed and cheered by it and so go out themselves to warm and cheer. ","The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun. ","Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up. ","It is a grand thing to rise in the world. The ambition to do so is the very salt of the earth. It is the parent of all enterprise, and the cause of all improvement. ","We could learn a lot from crayons; some are sharp, some are pretty, some are dull, while others bright, some have weird names, but they all have learned to live together in the same box. ","Trust yourself. Create the kind of self that you will be happy to live with all your life. Make the most of yourself by fanning the tiny, inner sparks of possibility into flames of achievement.  ","Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward. When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. ","I have yet to find a man or woman, however exalted their station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than under a spirit of criticism.  ","For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction. ","Our job on earth isn't to criticize, reject, or judge. Our purpose is to offer a helping hand, compassion, and mercy. We are to do unto others as we hope they would do unto us. ","What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead. ","You cannot get through a single day without having an impact on the world around you. What you do makes a difference, and you have to decide what kind of difference you want to make. ","The world is not interested in what we do for a living. What they are interested in is what we have to offer freely - hope, strength, love and the power to make a difference!\n ","If a person seems wicked, do not cast him away. Awaken him with your words, elevate him with your deeds, repay his injury with your kindness. Do not cast him away; cast away his wickedness. ","Games give you a chance to excel, and if you're playing in good company you don't even mind if you lose because you had the enjoyment of the company during the course of the game. ","We cannot seek achievement for ourselves and forget about progress and prosperity for our community...Our ambitions must be broad enough to include the aspirations and needs of others, for their sakes and for our own. ","We are reminded how short life really is, and how we are just passing through. So, all the people you haven't told you love lately, tell them, and live your days like you mean it. ","I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. ","Don\u2019t let others tell you what you can\u2019t do. Don't let the limitations of others limit your vision. If you can remove your self-doubt and believe in yourself, you can achieve what you never thought possible. ","Grit is that \u2018extra something\u2019 that separates the most successful people from the rest. It\u2019s the passion, perseverance, and stamina that we must channel in order to stick with our dreams until they become a reality. ","If your dream is a big dream, and if you want your life to work on the high level you say you do, there\u2019s no way around doing the work it takes to get you there. ","Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart. ","The nature of humanity, its essence, is to feel another\u2019s pain as one\u2019s own, and to act to take that pain away. There is a nobility in compassion, a beauty in empathy, a grace in forgiveness. ","When you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.  ","The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime. ","If you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something. ","The problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities. We need people who can dream of things that never were and ask 'why not'? ","Somewhere behind the athlete you've become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back... play for her. ","Gratitude is the beginning of civility, of decency and goodness, of a recognition that we cannot afford to be arrogant. We should walk with the knowledge that we will need help every step of the way. ","There\u2019s always going to be bad stuff out there. But here\u2019s the amazing thing - light trumps darkness every time. You stick a candle into the dark, but you can\u2019t stick the dark into the light. ","I am only one, but still I am one. I cannot do everything, but still I can do something; and because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do something that I can do. ","When you are joyful, when you say yes to life and have fun and project positivity all around you, you become a sun in the center of every constellation, and people want to be near you. ","This is part of what a family is about, not just love. It's knowing that your family will be there watching out for you. Nothing else will give you that. Not money. Not fame. Not work. ","The one thing all famous authors, world class athletes, business tycoons, singers, actors, and celebrated achievers in any field have in common is that they all began their journeys when they were none of these things. ","Freedom, morality, and the human dignity of the individual consists precisely in this; that he does good not because he is forced to do so, but because he freely conceives it, wants it, and loves it. ","It is tenderness for the past, courage for the present, hope for the future.  It is a fervent wish that every cup may overflow with blessings rich and eternal, and that every path may lead to peace. ","Your ambition should be to get as much life out of living as you possibly can, as much enjoyment, as much interest, as much experience, as much understanding. Not simply be what is generally called a \u2018success.\u2019 ","No soul that aspires can ever fail to rise; no heart that loves can ever be abandoned. Difficulties exist only that in overcoming them we may grow strong, and they who have suffered are able to save. ","Watch your thoughts; for they become words.\nWatch your words; for they become actions.\nWatch your actions; for they become habits.\nWatch your habits; for they become character.\nWatch your character for it will become your destiny. ","We can each define ambition and progress for ourselves. The goal is to work toward a world where expectations are not set by the stereotypes that hold us back, but by our personal passion, talents and interests. ","If a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it shows he is a citizen of the world, and that his heart is no island cut off from other lands, but a continent that joins to them. ","Live with intention. Walk to the edge. Listen Hard. Practice wellness. Play with abandon. Laugh. Choose with no regrets. Appreciate your friends. Continue to learn. Do what you love. Live as if this is all there is. ","To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting. ","Ultimately, we have just one moral duty: to reclaim large areas of peace in ourselves\u2026,and to reflect it towards others. And the more peace there is in us, the more peace there will be in our troubled world. ","Practice civility toward one another. Admire and emulate ethical behavior wherever you find it. Apply a rigid standard of morality to your lives; and if, periodically, you fail as you surely will, \xadadjust your lives, not the standards.  ","If there is any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not deter or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. ","Hope is not pretending that troubles don't exist. It is the hope that they won't last forever. That hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. That we will be led out of the darkness and into the sunshine. ","Hope can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual magic in it, but when you know what you hope for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, almost like magic. ","When I was a child my mother said to me, \u2018If you become a soldier, you\u2019ll be a general. If you become a monk, you\u2019ll be the pope.\u2019 Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso. ","This is the art of courage: to see things as they are and still believe that the victory lies not with those who avoid the bad, but those who taste, in living awareness, every drop of the good. ","Love is a force more formidable than any other. It is invisible\u2014it cannot be seen or measured, yet it is powerful enough to transform you in a moment, and offer you more joy than any material possession could. ","We haven't all had the good fortune to be ladies; we haven't all been generals, or poets, or statesmen; but when the toast works down to the babies, we stand on common ground\u2014for we have all been babies. ","Normal day, let me be aware of the treasure you are. Let me learn from you, love you, bless you before you depart. Let me not pass you by in the quest of some rare and perfect tomorrow. ","A pessimist, they say, sees a glass as being half empty; an optimist sees the same glass as half full. But a giving person sees a glass of water and starts looking for someone who might be thirsty. ","If you don't know the guy on the other side of the world, love him anyway because he's just like you. He has the same dreams, the same hopes and fears. It's one world, pal. We're all neighbors.\n ","If a choice lines up so that it supports truth, health, happiness, wisdom and love, it\u2019s the right choice.  ","I've always found that anything worth achieving will always have obstacles in the way and you've got to have that drive and determination to overcome those obstacles on route to whatever it is that you want to accomplish. ","When you know who you are; when your mission is clear and you burn with the inner fire of unbreakable will; no cold can touch your heart; no deluge can dampen your purpose. You know that you are alive. ","May you always be blessed with walls for the wind. A roof for the rain. A warm cup of tea by the fire. Laughter to cheer you. Those you love near you. And all that your heart might desire. ","If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder, he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it, rediscovering with him the joy, excitement and mystery of the world we live in. ","Hope is a state of mind, not of the world. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well\u2026, but rather an ability to work for something because it is good. ","You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself in any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. You are the one who'll decide where to go.  ","For what it\u2019s worth: It\u2019s never too late to be whoever you want to be. I hope you live a life you\u2019re proud of, and if you find you\u2019re not, I hope you have the strength to start over again. ","Our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do. Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another. ","Knowing that you love the earth changes you, activates you to defend and protect and celebrate. But when you feel that the earth loves you in return, that feeling transforms the relationship from a one-way street into a sacred bond. ","It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart. ","The capacity for getting along with our neighbor depends to a large extent on the capacity for getting along with ourselves. The self-respecting individual will try to be as tolerant of his neighbor's shortcomings as he is of his own. ","You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go...  ","This I know. This I believe with all my heart. If we want a free and peaceful world, if we want to make deserts bloom and man to grow to greater dignity as a human being we can do it!  ","The power of love to change bodies is legendary, built into folklore, common sense, and everyday experience. Love moves the flesh, it pushes matter around... Throughout history, tender loving care has uniformly been recognized as a valuable element in healing. ","Don't ever forget that you're a citizen of this world, and there are things you can do to lift the human spirit, things that are easy, things that are free, things that you can do every day: civility, respect, kindness, character. ","You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated. In fact, it may be necessary to encounter the defeats, so you can know who you are, what you can rise from, how you can still come out of it. ","If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us. ","Good character is more to be praised than outstanding talent. Most talents are to some extent a gift. Good character, by contrast, is not given to us. We have to build it piece by piece by thought, choice, courage and determination. ","I speak not for myself but for those without voice\u2026 those who have fought for their rights\u2026 their right to live in peace, their right to be treated with dignity, their right to equality of opportunity, their right to be educated. ","Grit is not just a simple elbow-grease term for rugged persistence. It is an often invisible display of endurance that lets you stay in an uncomfortable place, work hard to improve upon a given interest and do it again and again. ","Success is not just the crowning moment, the spiking of the ball in the end zone or the raising of the flag on the summit. It is the whole process of reaching for a goal and, sometimes, it begins with failure. ","How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong. Because someday in your life you will have been all of these. ","Service is a smile.  It is an acknowledging wave, a reaching handshake, a friendly wink, and a warm hug.   It's these simple acts that matter most, because the greatest service to a human soul has always been the kindness of recognition. ","You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment. Fools stand on their island of opportunities and look toward another land. There is no other land; there is no other life but this. ","You have to know what you want to get. But when you know that, let it take you. And if it seems to take you off the track, don't hold back because perhaps that is instinctively where you want to be. ","Do all the good you can. By all the means you can. In all the ways you can. In all the places you can. At all the times you can. To all the people you can. As long as ever you can. ","Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. ","To find the universal elements enough; to find the air and the water exhilarating; to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at night\u2014these are some of the rewards of the simple life. ","How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. ","We should cultivate the ability to say no to activities for which we have no interest or real concern. If we learn to say no to many things, then we will be able to say yes to the things that matter most.  ","When you get in a tight place and everything goes against you, till it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer, never give up then, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn. ","Most people are like you and me, or the people across the street or around the world from you and me. Just like you and me, their hearts tell them that somewhere, somehow, they can make a positive difference in the world.  ","Wherever you turn, you can find someone who needs you. Even if it is a little thing, do something for which there is no pay but the privilege of doing it. Remember, you don\u2019t live in the world all of your own. ","How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving, and tolerant of the weak and the strong, because someday in your life, you will have been all of these. ","Once a man has made a commitment to a way of life, he puts the greatest strength in the world behind him. It's something we call heart power. Once a man has made this commitment, nothing will stop him short of success. ","Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded. It's a relationship between equals. Only when we know our own darkness well can we be present with the darkness of others. Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity. ","If you treat an individual as he is, he will remain how he is. But if you treat him as if he were what he ought to be and could be, he will become what he ought to be and could be. ","It's not enough to have lived. We should be determined to live for something. May I suggest that it be creating joy for others, sharing what we have for the betterment of personkind, bringing hope to the lost and love to the lonely. ","Compassion is the sometimes fatal capacity for feeling what it is like to live inside somebody else's skin. It's the knowledge that there can never really be any peace and joy for me until there is peace and joy finally for you too. ","Mindfulness is simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different; enjoying the pleasant without holding on when it changes (which it will); being with the unpleasant without fearing it will always be this way (which it won\u2019t). ","Giving is so often thought of in terms of the things we give, but our greatest giving is of our time, and kindness, and even comfort for those who need it. We look on these gifts as unimportant \u2013 until we need them. ","It is man's social nature which distinguishes him from the brute creation. If it is his privilege to be independent, it is equally his duty to be inter-dependent. Only an arrogant man will claim to be independent of everybody else and be self-contained. ","Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness... or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have\u2014life itself. ","I place a high moral value on the way people behave. I find it repellent to have a lot, and to behave with anything other than courtesy in the old sense of the word - politeness of the heart, a gentleness of the spirit. ","If you shift your focus from yourself to others, extend your concern to others, and cultivate the thought of caring for the well being of others, then this will have the immediate effect of opening up your life and helping you to reach out. ","People are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don't believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can't find them, make them. ","Perhaps love is like a resting place, a shelter from the storm. It exists to give you comfort, it is there to keep you warm, and in those times of trouble when you are most alone, the memory of love will bring you home.\n ","Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.  ","I was set free because my greatest fear had been realized, and I still had a daughter who I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became a solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life. ","Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming \u201cWow! What a Ride!\u201d  ","I\u2019m beginning to recognize that real happiness isn\u2019t something large and looming on the horizon ahead, but something small, numerous and already here. The smile of someone you love. A decent breakfast. The warm sunset. Your little everyday joys all lined up in a row. ","You can kiss your family and friends good-bye and put miles between you, but at the same time you carry them with you in your heart, your mind, your stomach, because you do not just live in a world but a world lives in you. ","Your journey has molded you for the greater good, and it was exactly what it needed to be. Don't think that you've lost time. It took each and every situation you have encountered to bring you to the now. And now is right on time. ","All things are bound together. All things connect. Whatever happens to the Earth happens to the children of the Earth. Man did not weave the web of life, he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. ","The hero is one who kindles a great light in the world, who sets up blazing torches in the dark streets of life for men to see by. The saint is the man who walks through the dark paths of the world, himself a light. ","The best way to not feel hopeless is to get up and do something. Don\u2019t wait for good things to happen to you. If you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope. ","Our uniqueness, individuality, and life experiences mold us into fascinating beings. May we challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts and cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. ","Be soft. Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness. Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place. ","Change is not something that we should fear. Rather, it is something that we should welcome. For without change, nothing in this world would ever grow or blossom, and no one in this world would ever move forward to become the person they're meant to be. ","Opportunities, many times, are so small that we glimpse them not and yet they are often the seeds of great enterprises. Opportunities are also everywhere and so you must always let your hook be hanging. When you least expect it, a great fish will swim by. ","We are designed with a dreaming brain and a hopeful spirit; it is our nature to envision the life of our dreams. And while dreaming comes easy to us, we must never forget that it takes strength, dedication, and courageous action to bring that dream to life. ","The best thing to give to your enemy is forgiveness; to an opponent, tolerance; to a friend, your heart; to your child, a good example; to a father, deference; to your mother, conduct that will make her proud of you; to yourself, respect; to all men, charity. ","Ask not for an easy life...ask for the strength to face the elements, to weather the storms; to be the might for the right and the weak, to be the voice for those who cannot speak, to see one's dreams to fruition with dignity, integrity, and grace. ","Walk with the dreamers, the believers, the courageous, the cheerful, the planners, the doers, the successful people with their heads in the clouds and their feet on the ground. Let their spirit ignite a fire within you to leave this world better than when you found it. ","We don't beat the Grim Reaper by living longer, we beat the Reaper by living well and living fully, for the Reaper will come for all of us. The question is what do we do between the time we are born and the time he shows up. ","When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. ","I expect to pass through life but once. If therefore, there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, let me do it now, and not defer or neglect it, as I shall not pass this way again. ","The people closest to me determine my level of success or failure. The better they are, the better I am. And if I want to go to the highest level, I can do it only with the help of other people. We have to take each other higher. ","When you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. ","A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely. ","Always reward your long hours of labor surrounded by your family. Nurture their love carefully, remembering that your children need models, not critics. And even if you have failed at all else in the eyes of the world, if you have a loving family, you are a success. ","As you grow up, always tell the truth, do no harm to others, and don\u2019t think you are the most important being on earth. Rich or poor, you then can look anyone in the eye and say, \u2018I\u2019m probably no better than you, but I\u2019m certainly your equal. ","Hurt people, hurt people. That's how pain patterns get passed on, generation after generation after generation. Break the chain today. Meet anger with sympathy, contempt with compassion and cruelty with kindness. Greet grimaces with smiles. Forgive and forget about finding fault. Love is the weapon of the future. ","Gracious acceptance is an art\u2014an art which most never bother to cultivate. We think that we have to learn how to give, but we forget about accepting things, which can be much harder than giving... Accepting another person's gift is allowing him to express his feelings for you. ","As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out the present-moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love - even the most simple action.  ","A true leader has the confidence to stand alone, the courage to make tough decisions, and the compassion to listen to the needs of others. They do not set out to be a leader, but become one by the equality of their actions and the integrity of their intentions. ","There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are. It really matters very little whether they are behind the wheel of a truck or running a business or bringing up a family. They teach the truth by living it. ","I have never been a millionaire. But I have enjoyed a great meal, a crackling fire, a glorious sunset, a walk with a friend, a hug from a child, a cup of soup, a kiss behind the ear. There are plenty of life\u2019s tiny delights for all of us. ","I have missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I have lost almost 300 games. On 26 occasions I have been entrusted to take the game winning shot...and I missed. I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that's precisely why I succeed. ","You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand. ","To be creative means to be in love with life. You can be creative only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty, you want to bring a little more music to it, a little more poetry to it, a little more dance to it. ","Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? ","To put the world right in order, we must first put the nation in order; to put the nation in order, we must first put the family in order; to put the family in order, we must first cultivate our personal life; we must first set our hearts right. ","Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that frightens us most. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually who are you not to be?  ","I cannot believe that the purpose of life is to be happy. I think the purpose of life is to be useful, to be responsible, to be compassionate. It is, above all to matter, to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at all. ","When you come to the edge of all the light you have, and must take a step into the darkness of the unknown, believe that one of two things will happen. Either there will be something solid for you to stand on - or you will be taught how to fly. ","What if it becomes less about how we look and more about how much we care? What if it becomes less about how much money we earn and more about how much we share our good fortune? Imagine a world where who we are in our hearts is the ultimate status symbol. ","Don't ever give up. Don't ever give in. Don't ever stop trying. Don't ever sell out. And if you find yourself succumbing to one of the above for a brief moment, pick yourself up, brush yourself off, whisper a prayer, and start where you left off. But never, ever, ever give up. ","You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do. ","You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end, each of us must work for our own improvement and, at the same time, share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful. ","May Light always surround you;\nHope kindle and rebound you.\nMay your Hurts turn to Healing;\nYour Heart embrace Feeling.\nMay Wounds become Wisdom;\nEvery Kindness a Prism.\nMay Laughter infect you;\nYour Passion resurrect you.\nMay Goodness inspire your Deepest Desires.\nThrough all that you Reach For,\nMay your arms Never Tire.\n ","Your opponent, in the end, is never really the player on the other side of the net, or the swimmer in the next lane, or the team on the other side of the field, or even the bar you must high-jump. Your opponent is yourself, your negative internal voices, your level of determination. ","It is a mistake to think that the practice of my art has become easy to me. I assure you, dear friend, no one has given so much care to the study of composition as I. There is scarcely a famous master in music whose works I have not frequently and diligently studied. ","The wise do not buy into other people\u2019s perceptions of who they are and what they are capable of. Instead, they bypass a person\u2019s public persona and see who they are in their highest expression. When you see actions taken with integrity, instead of words only, you will then know a soul\u2019s worth. ","Be of good cheer. Do not think of today's failures, but of the success that may come tomorrow. You have set yourselves a difficult task, but you will succeed if you persevere; and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles. Remember, no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost. ","I don't want to live in the kind of world where we don't look out for each other. Not just the people that are close to us, but anybody who needs a helping hand. I can't change the way anybody else thinks, or what they choose to do, but I can do my bit. ","In the end, though, maybe we must all give up trying to pay back the people in this world who sustain our lives. In the end, maybe it's wiser to surrender before the miraculous scope of human generosity and to just keep saying thank you, forever and sincerely, for as long as we have voices. ","Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day-in, day-out. Not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years. And working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint. ","We have to stand up for what we believe in, even when we might not be popular for it. Honesty starts with being ourselves, authentic and true to who we are and what we believe in, and that may not always be popular, but it will always let you follow your dreams and your heart. ","If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, \u201dHere comes number seventy-one!\u201d ","I have never met a person whose greatest need was anything other than real, unconditional love. You can find it in a simple act of kindness toward someone who needs help. There is no mistaking love\u2026it is the common fiber of life, the flame that heats our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. ","The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths. These persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern. Beautiful people do not just happen. ","Watch the sunrise at least once a year, put a lot of marshmallows in your hot chocolate, lie on your back and look at the stars, never buy a coffee table you can't put your feet on, never pass up a chance to jump on a trampoline, don't overlook life's small joys while searching for the big ones. ","Each of us can look back upon someone who made a great difference in our lives, someone whose wisdom or simple acts of caring made an impression upon us. In all likelihood it was someone who sought no recognition for their deed other than the joy of knowing that, by their hand, another's life had been made better. ","The best day of your life is the one on which you decide your life is your own. No apologies or excuses. No one to lean on, rely on, or blame. The gift is yours - it is an amazing journey - and you alone are responsible for the quality of it. This is the day your life really begins. ","Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend. Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow. ","The moment when you first wake up in the morning is the most wonderful of the twenty-four hours. No matter how weary or dreary you may feel, you possess the certainty that, during the day that lies before you, absolutely anything may happen. And the fact that it practically always doesn\u2019t matters not a jot. The possibility is always there. ","But where was I to start? The world is so vast, I shall start with the country I know best, my own. But my country is so very large. I had better start with my town. But my town too, is large. I had best start with my street. No: my home. No: my family. Never mind, I shall start with myself. ","I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death. ","There\u2019s something very freeing about losing the anchors that have always defined you. Frightening, sad, but exhilarating in a poignant way, as well. You\u2019re free to float to the moon and evaporate or sink to the bottom of the deepest ocean. But you\u2019re free to explore. Some people confuse that with drifting, I suppose. I like to think of it as growing. ","If there is to be peace in the world, there must be peace in the nations. If there is to be peace in the nations, there must be peace in the cities. If there is to be peace in the cities, there must be peace between neighbors. If there is to be peace between neighbors, there must be peace in the home. If there is to be peace in the home, there must be peace in the heart.\n ","Those who make compassion an essential part of their lives find the joy of life. Kindness deepens the spirit and produces rewards that cannot be completely explained in words. It is an experience more powerful than words. To become acquainted with kindness one must be prepared to learn new things and feel new feelings. Kindness is more than a philosophy of the mind. It is a philosophy of the spirit.  ","I will follow the upward road today; I will keep my face to the light. I will think high thoughts as I go my way; I will do what I know is right. I will look for the flowers by the side of the road; I will laugh and love and be strong. I will try to lighten another\u2019s load this day as I fare along. ","The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work, and the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking, don't settle. ","I began to realize how important it was to be an enthusiast in life. He taught me that if you are interested in something, no matter what it is, go at it at full speed ahead. Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be. ","Wouldn't it be powerful if you fell in love with yourself so deeply that you would do just about anything if you knew it would make you happy? This is precisely how much life loves you and wants you to nurture yourself. The deeper you love yourself, the more the universe will affirm your worth. Then you can enjoy a lifelong love affair that brings you the richest fulfillment from inside out. ","When someone steals another's clothes, we call them a thief. Should we not give the same name to one who could clothe the naked and does not? The bread in your cupboard belongs to the hungry; the coat unused in your closet belongs to the one who needs it; the shoes rotting in your closet belong to the one who has no shoes; the money which you hoard up belongs to the poor. ","When I say it's you I like, I'm talking about that part of you that knows that life is far more than anything you can ever see or hear or touch. That deep part of you that allows you to stand for those things without which humankind cannot survive. Love that conquers hate, peace that rises triumphant over war, and justice that proves more powerful than greed. ","Remember when you go into the world to keep your eyes and ears wide open. And be kind. Love one another. Take care of each other. Tell the truth. Always do your best. Listen to the big people and the little people. Explore new paths and have fun. Know that you are loved like crazy. Give thanks for all your blessings. Above all else, Love and you will do wonderful things in this world. ",'Does the sun ask itself, "Am I good? Am I worthwhile? Is there enough of me?" No, it burns and it shines. Does the sun ask itself, "What does the moon think of me? How does Mars feel about me today?" No it burns, it shines. Does the sun ask itself, "Am I as big as other suns in other galaxies?" No, it burns, it shines. ',"Your time is limited, so don\u2019t waste it living someone else's life. Don\u2019t be trapped by dogma- which is living with the results of other people\u2019s thinking. Don\u2019t let the noise of other\u2019s opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
